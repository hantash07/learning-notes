## Enum Classes
- It is used to define set of constant value that represent different options.
- Enum are classes that can have properties, methods and can even implements interfaces and abstract classes.
- Each enum constant is an object.
- Enum is a type safe.
```
enum class Direction {
    NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
}
```

### Enum with Properties and Methods
- Enums in Kotlin can also have properties and methods, which makes them much more flexible than traditional enums.
```
enum class Color(val rgb: Int) {
    RED(0xFF0000),
    GREEN(0x00FF00),
    BLUE(0x0000FF);

    fun containsRed() = (rgb and 0xFF0000 != 0)
}
```

### Enum with Custom Constructors
- If you want each enum constant with specific values, you can provide constructors
```
enum class Planet(val mass: Double, val radius: Double) {
    EARTH(5.97e24, 6.371e6),
    MARS(0.64171e24, 3.3895e6),
    JUPITER(1898.19e24, 69.911e6);

    // Gravitational constant
    val G = 6.67430e-11

    fun surfaceGravity() = G * mass / (radius * radius)
}
```

### Using Enums
- You can use enums like this:
```
fun main() {
    val direction = Direction.NORTH
    println(direction)  // Output: NORTH

    val favoriteColor = Color.GREEN
    println(favoriteColor.rgb)  // Output: 65280
    println(favoriteColor.containsRed())  // Output: false
}
```

### Enum with Interfaces
- Enums can also implement interfaces, which is useful for defining common behavior:
```
interface Printable {
    fun print()
}

enum class Season : Printable {
    WINTER {
        override fun print() = println("Cold and snowy!")
    },
    SUMMER {
        override fun print() = println("Hot and sunny!")
    },
    SPRING {
        override fun print() = println("Flowers blooming!")
    },
    AUTUMN {
        override fun print() = println("Leaves falling!")
    }
}
```

- And then use it like this:
```
fun main() {
    Season.WINTER.print()  // Output: Cold and snowy!
}
```

### Enum with Anonymous Classes
- Enum can define anonymous classes to each constant.
- This is useful when each constant in an enum needs a different implementation of a function.
```
enum class Operation {
    ADD {
        override fun apply(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
    },
    SUBTRACT {
        override fun apply(x: Int, y: Int) = x - y
    },
    MULTIPLY {
        override fun apply(x: Int, y: Int) = x * y
    },
    DIVIDE {
        override fun apply(x: Int, y: Int) = if (y != 0) x / y else throw IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero")
    };

    abstract fun apply(x: Int, y: Int): Int
}

```

- The `apply` function is declared as `abstract` in the enum. Each constant must provide its own implementation of `apply`, defining its unique behavior.
- You can use this enum as follows:
```
fun main() {
    val x = 10
    val y = 5

    println(Operation.ADD.apply(x, y))        // Output: 15
    println(Operation.SUBTRACT.apply(x, y))   // Output: 5
    println(Operation.MULTIPLY.apply(x, y))   // Output: 50
    println(Operation.DIVIDE.apply(x, y))     // Output: 2
}

```

- This approach is useful when each enum constant has slightly different behavior that needs its own logic. In this example, each `Operation` constant provides a unique implementation of the `apply` function.
