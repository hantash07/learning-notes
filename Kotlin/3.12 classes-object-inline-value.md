## Inline Value Classes
- It is used to create a lightweight wrapper for a single value.
- It is used to wrap a value in a class to create more domain specific type.
- It improves performance as it avoid object allocation.
- To declare an inline class, use the `value` modifier before the name of the class:
```
value class Meter(val value: Double)
```
- `Meter` is an inline value class that wraps a `Double`.
- At runtime, the `Meter` class will often be compiled down to just the `Double`, reducing overhead.

### Limitations:
- Primary Constructor with a single parameter.
- Cannot have backing fields.
- Implement interfaces but no class inheritance.
- Inline value classes are immutable.

### Members:
- Inline classes support some functionality of regular classes. They are allowed to declare properties and functions, have an `init` block and secondary constructor.
```
value class Person(private val fullName: String) {
    init {
        require(fullName.isNotEmpty()) {
            "Full name shouldn't be empty"
        }
    }

    constructor(firstName: String, lastName: String) : this("$firstName $lastName") {
        require(lastName.isNotBlank()) {
            "Last name shouldn't be empty"
        }
    }

    val length: Int
        get() = fullName.length

    fun greet() {
        println("Hello, $fullName")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val name1 = Person("Kotlin", "Mascot")
    val name2 = Person("Kodee")
    name1.greet() // the `greet()` function is called as a static method
    println(name2.length) // property getter is called as a static method
}
```

### Performance
- There is no need to create additional objects at runtime. 
- No allocation of an object at runtime. The type is define at compile time. This make performance improved.
```
data class Email(val value: String)  // Allocates an object at runtime.

@JvmInline
value class Email(val value: String) // Treated as String at runtime.
```

### Type Safe
- Type of the data is defined during the compile time.
- Inline value classes help prevent logical errors by creating **strongly typed wrappers** for primitive types or other values. This ensures that only the correct type can be passed where required.
```
@JvmInline
value class Email(val value: String)

fun sendEmail(email: Email) { /* ... */ }
// sendEmail("invalid_format") // ❌ Compilation error.
sendEmail(Email("user@example.com")) // ✅ Correct usage.
```

### Domain-Specific Modeling
- Inline value classes make it easy to model domain-specific concepts explicitly, making your code more **expressive** and **self-documenting**.
```
// Instead of using raw primitives:
fun transfer(amount: Double, fromAccount: String, toAccount: String) { /* ... */ }


// You can define:
@JvmInline
value class Amount(val value: Double)
@JvmInline
value class Account(val id: String)

fun transfer(amount: Amount, fromAccount: Account, toAccount: Account) { /* ... */ }
```

### Custom Validation
- Inline value classes can enforce **validation rules** during initialization, ensuring that only valid data is created.
```
@JvmInline
value class PositiveInt(val value: Int) {
    init {
        require(value > 0) { "Value must be positive" }
    }
}

val validNumber = PositiveInt(5) // ✅ Works.
// val invalidNumber = PositiveInt(-3) // ❌ Throws IllegalArgumentException.
```

###  Inline value classes vs. Data classes
- Both the classes are designed for immutability.
- Data classes are more flexible and can be used for complex data and having more than one property. In comparison, Inline classes can have single property.
- Inline classes are good in performance, as there is no additional allocation of objects at runtime.
