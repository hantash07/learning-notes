## Functional Interface SAM
- An interface with only one abstract method is called functional interface or single abstract method interface.
- Functional interface can have several non abstract method.
- To declare a functional interface in Kotlin, use the `fun` modifier

  ```
  fun interface KRunnable {
   fun invoke()
  }
  ```

- For functional interfaces, you can use SAM conversions that help make your code more concise and readable by using lambda expressions.

  ```
  fun interface IntPredicate {
   fun accept(i: Int): Boolean
  }

  val isEven = IntPredicate { it % 2 == 0 }

  fun main() {
     println("Is 7 even? - ${isEven.accept(7)}")
  }
  ```
