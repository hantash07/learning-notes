## Visibility Modifiers
- Classes, objects, interfaces, constructors, and functions, as well as properties and their setters, can have visibility modifiers. Getters always have the same visibility as their properties.
- There are four visibility modifiers in Kotlin: `private`, `protected`, `internal`, and `public`. The default visibility is `public`.
- `private` modifier means that the declaration inside a class is only available inside that class. For top level declaration, this will be visible inside the file.
- `protected` declaration only available in its class and subclass.
- `public` modifier means that the declarations are visible everywhere.
- 'internal' modifier means that the declaration are visible inside a module.

### Packages
- Functions, properties, classes, objects, and interfaces can be declared at the "top-level" directly inside a package:
  ```
  // file name: example.kt
  package foo

  private fun foo() { ... } // visible inside example.kt

  public var bar: Int = 5 // property is visible everywhere
    private set         // setter is visible only in example.kt

  internal val baz = 6    // visible inside the same module
  ```
### Class members
```
open class Outer {
    private val a = 1
    protected open val b = 2
    internal open val c = 3
    val d = 4  // public by default

    protected class Nested {
        public val e: Int = 5
    }
}

class Subclass : Outer() {
    // a is not visible
    // b, c and d are visible
    // Nested and e are visible

    override val b = 5   // 'b' is protected
    override val c = 7   // 'c' is internal
}

class Unrelated(o: Outer) {
    // o.a, o.b are not visible
    // o.c and o.d are visible (same module)
    // Outer.Nested is not visible, and Nested::e is not visible either
}
```
### Constructors
- In order to add modifier in a constructor, a `constructor` keyword is reqiored.
  ```
  class C private constructor(a: Int) { ... }
  ```
- Here the constructor is private. By default, all constructors are public, which effectively amounts to them being visible everywhere the class is visible (this means that a constructor of an internal class is only visible within the same module).
