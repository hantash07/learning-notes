### Extensions
- Kotlin provides the ability to extend a class or an interface with new functionality without having to inherit from the class.
- For example, you can write new functions for a class or an interface from a third-party library that you can't modify. Such functions can be called in the usual way, as if they were methods of the original class. This mechanism is called an extension function. There are also extension properties that let you define new properties for existing classes.
