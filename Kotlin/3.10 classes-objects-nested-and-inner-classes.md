## Nested and Inner Classes
- In Kotlin, nested and inner classes allow you to define classes inside other classes.
- These two inner classes have different behaviour with their outer class.

### Nested Classes
- A class define inside another class without any reference to the instance of the outer class.
- It cannot access the members of the outer class.
- They are like static class.
- Nested classes can be initialized without the instance of the outer class.
- No special keyword is required.
- You can nested interfaces in classes, classes in interfaces and interfaces and interfaces.
```
class Outer { 
	private val bar: Int = 1 
	
	class Nested {
		fun foo() = 2 
	} 
} 

val demo = Outer.Nested().foo() // == 2
```

### Inner Classes
- A class define inside another class with `inner` keyword.
- It can access the member of outer class as inner class have the reference of the outer class instance.
- Inner class can be initialized with the instance of the outer class.
- `inner` keyword is required.
```
class Outer {
    val outerData = "Outer class data"

    // Inner class
    inner class Inner {
        fun accessOuterData() = "Accessing: $outerData"
    }
}


fun main() {
    // Create an instance of the outer class
    val outer = Outer()

    // Create an instance of the inner class
    val inner = outer.Inner()

    // Call a method of the inner class
    println(inner.accessOuterData())  // Output: Accessing: Outer class data
}
```
