- Jetpack Compose is a declarative approach, which means the UI automatically updates when the state changes.
- The state represents the data that UI uses to display. When the state changes, the UI recomposes or redesigns to display newly updated data.

### Recomposition
- It is the process of updating the UI when the state changes. 
- It allows Compose to efficiently rebuild specific parts of the UI that need to be updated, rather than recreating the entire UI.

### Types of State
#### 1. Remembered State (`remember` and `rememberSaveable`)
- This is used to cache the data used in composable functions.
- Normally, when a composable function is recomposed, it re-executes its body. Without `remember`, any value or object initialized in the composable function will be reset on every recomposition. By using `remember`, the value is initialized only once and reused across recomposition.
- It does not notify Compose of changes.
- It is bound to the composable's lifecycle.
- Use `remember` to store a state across recompositions.
- Use `rememberSaveable` to save state across configuration changes.
```
@Composable
fun RememberExample() {
    val counter = remember { 0 } // Value is retained during recomposition
    Text(text = "Counter: $counter")
}
```

#### 2. Mutable State (`mutableStateOf`)
- A state holder that updates the UI when its value changes.
- It is used in recomposing composable UI.
- It creates observable state variables that automatically notify Compose to recompose when the value is updated.
```
@Composable
fun MutableStateExample() {
    var counter by mutableStateOf(0) // State that triggers recomposition
    Text(text = "Counter: $counter")
}
```
##### Combining `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
- These are used together because `mutableStateOf` creates a state and `remember` ensures the state is retained across recompositions.
```
@Composable
fun CounterExample() {
    var counter by remember { mutableStateOf(0) } // Retain state across recompositions
    Column {
        Text(text = "Counter: $counter")
        Button(onClick = { counter++ }) {
            Text("Increment")
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Derived State (`derivedStateOf`)
- Creating a state based on the value of another state.
- The state depends on the computed or calculated value of another state.
- It optimizes recomposition by avoiding unnecessary recompositions.
- It ensures that recompositions only occur if the computed value changes, not every time-dependent state changes.
```
@Composable
fun DerivedStateExample() {
    var inputText by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
    val isLongText = derivedStateOf { inputText.length > 10 }

    Column {
        TextField(
            value = inputText,
            onValueChange = { inputText = it },
            label = { Text("Enter text") }
        )
        if (isLongText.value) {
            Text("Your text is long!")
        } else {
            Text("Your text is short!")
        }
    }
}
```
- The `text` composable will only recompose when the `isLongText.value` changes. In this way, unnecessary recompositions can be avoided when text length changes.

#### 3. State Hoisting
- A design pattern where the state is managed at a higher level composition or parent, and it is passed down to child composable. The child composable is responsible for updating the UI based on the state, but they do not directly manage the state.
- It is basically used to make Composable functions stateless. The state of the composable is managed outside by its parent compose function.
- With state hoisting, it can make composable functions reusable and easy to test.
##### Example Without State Hoisting
```
@Composable
fun Counter() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    Column(
        horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
    ) {
        Text("Count: $count", fontSize = 24.sp)
        Button(onClick = { count++ }) {
            Text("Increment")
        }
    }
}
```

#####  Example With State Hoisting
```
// Child Composable (Stateless)
@Composable
fun CounterDisplay(count: Int, onIncrement: () -> Unit) {
    Column(
        horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
    ) {
        Text("Count: $count", fontSize = 24.sp)
        Button(onClick = onIncrement) {
            Text("Increment")
        }
    }
}


// Parent Composable (Manages State)
@Composable
fun CounterParent() {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    CounterDisplay(count = count, onIncrement = { count++ })
}
```

 ##### Advanced Example: Two-way Data Binding
 - State Hoisting supports two-way binding patterns, where the child modifies the state.
```
// Child Composable (Stateless TextField)
@Composable
fun TextInput(value: String, onValueChange: (String) -> Unit) {
    TextField(
        value = value,
        onValueChange = onValueChange,
        label = { Text("Enter Text") }
    )
}


// Parent Composable** (State Management)
@Composable
fun ParentTextInput() {
    var text by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
    Column {
        TextInput(value = text, onValueChange = { text = it })
        Text("You entered: $text")
    }
}
```

##### When to Hoist State?
- If the parent composable needs to control the state.
- If the state needs to be shared across multiple composables.
- If the child composable must remain reusable and independent.
##### Combine with ViewModels
- For larger apps, manage the state using `ViewModel` to ensure the state survives configuration changes.
