- Jetpack Compose is a declarative approach, which means the UI automatically updates when the state changes.
- The state represents the data that UI uses to display. When the state changes, the UI recomposes or redesigns to display newly updated data.

### Recomposition
- It is the process of updating the UI when the state changes. 
- It allows Compose to efficiently rebuild specific parts of the UI that need to be updated, rather than recreating the entire UI.

### Types of State
#### 1. Remembered State (`remember` and `rememberSaveable`)
- This is used to cache the data used in composable functions.
- Normally, when a composable function is recomposed, it re-executes its body. Without `remember`, any value or object initialized in the composable function will be reset on every recomposition. By using `remember`, the value is initialized only once and reused across recomposition.
- It does not notify Compose of changes.
- It is bound to the composable's lifecycle.
- Use `remember` to store a state across recompositions.
- Use `rememberSaveable` to save state across configuration changes.
```
@Composable
fun RememberExample() {
    val counter = remember { 0 } // Value is retained during recomposition
    Text(text = "Counter: $counter")
}
```
#### 2. Mutable State (`mutableStateOf`)
- A state holder that updates the UI when its value changes.
- It is used in recomposing composable UI.
- It creates observable state variables that automatically notify Compose to recompose when the value is updated.
```
@Composable
fun MutableStateExample() {
    var counter by mutableStateOf(0) // State that triggers recomposition
    Text(text = "Counter: $counter")
}
```
##### Combining `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
- These are used together because `mutableStateOf` creates a state and `remember` ensures the state is retained across recompositions.
```
@Composable
fun CounterExample() {
    var counter by remember { mutableStateOf(0) } // Retain state across recompositions
    Column {
        Text(text = "Counter: $counter")
        Button(onClick = { counter++ }) {
            Text("Increment")
        }
    }
}
```
